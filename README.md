## 📊 Data Insights Summary

This dashboard explores **global Electric Vehicle (EV) trends** using IEA data, covering total sales, stock, market share, and public infrastructure across regions and modes (cars, buses, trucks, vans). SQL and Power BI were used for data modeling, while custom Python logic was applied to calculate projections and year-over-year growth.

---

### 🔹 Dataset Coverage:
- Timeframe: 2010–2035 (actual + projection)
- Scope: **Global + regional data** (China, Europe, US, etc.)
- Metrics: **EV Sales, Stocks, Sales Share, Charging Points**
- Scenarios: **APS (Accelerated)** vs **STEPS (Stated Policies)**

---

### 🔹 Key Observations:
- 🚗 **EV Sales (2023)**: 14.2 million units sold globally  
- 📈 **YOY Growth (2022→2023)**: +35.2%, indicating rapid adoption  
- 🔌 **Charging Points (2023)**: 2.7 million public chargers deployed  
- 🔮 **Future Forecast (APS)**:  
  - 2025: 18.5M  
  - 2030: 33M  
  - 2035: 45M  
- 🆚 **BEV vs PHEV (2030 APS)**: BEVs ~72%, PHEVs ~23%

---

### 💡 What This Dashboard Helps With:
- ✅ Track growth in EV adoption by region and vehicle type  
- ✅ Compare EV targets across **policy scenarios (APS vs STEPS)**  
- ✅ Understand infrastructure readiness (charging points)  
- ✅ Supports decision-making for energy, auto, and policy sectors

> 📌 Use slicers to filter by **mode, region, category, year**.  
> YOY growth, projections, and shares dynamically update for selected filters.
